Processor circuit built in logisim. Implements instruction set created by instructor Jason Tang at UMBC (see ULNAv1.pdf) for instruction set details
multiplier.img generated from test program multiplier.S provided by Jason Tang
ulna-as.c is an assembler for the instruction set provided by Jason Tang
Makefile provided by Jason Tang
ulna-dis.c Dissasembler created by Travis Earley


All non-basic components (adders etc.) created by Travis Earley using basic components in logisim

Instructions using Logisim:
1. Reset simulation
2. Load multiplier.img into instruction memory (left side RAM)
3. Enable simulation
4. Enable ticks
5. Wait until system halts (repeats insutruction f800)
6. Stop simulation, then examine data memory (right side RAM) 0xfffe for result (last memory adress)
