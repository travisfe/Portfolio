Extreemly basic code used as basis found here: https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/

The goal of the neural net is to predict whether an object is close or far away from the origin. Close is defined here as within 3
miles.

The data is layed out in a csv file with the first row and column each containing title information. Each row is an observation.
There are 16 columns not including the title column for the data. The first 13 are each one sensor, which say how far an object is
from that particular sensor. They are labeles 'N/A' if the object is not in range of the sensor. The last 3 columns contain the
actual x coordinate of the object, the actual y coordinate of the object, and the distance from the origin.
